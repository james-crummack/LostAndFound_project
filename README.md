# Lost & Found Management System

A polyglot persistence web application designed for managing lost and found items across a transport network. This project demonstrates the integration of **MySQL** (RDBMS) and **MongoDB** (NoSQL) with **Flask** as the backend framework. It includes full **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**, CRUD operations, and SQL/NoSQL interoperability.

##  Features

-  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin, Employee, and User roles with dynamic permissions.
-  **CRUD Support**: Perform Create, Read, Update, Delete operations across SQL and MongoDB.
-  **Polyglot Persistence**: Combines the structure of MySQL with the flexibility of MongoDB.
-  **Data Export**: Query results can be downloaded as CSV.
-  **Bootstrap-styled UI**: Clean, dark-mode interface for a better UX.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB
- **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap
- **Other**: Jinja2 templating, CSV export
